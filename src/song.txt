Chest Pain (I Love)
By: Malcolm Todd

[Chorus]
My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
They all said it would fade, but again and again
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love

[Verse]
I've been so busy
But now that I'm alone
Where did you go?
Tell me why
Why can't you live at home tonight and stay with me inside?
It's nice
Please, I wanna see what we would be if you were by my side
Make me feel lonely, soon
You might not know me, I wish I could lie
But I can't deny

[Chorus]
My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
They all said it would fade, but again and again
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love

[Chorus]
I'm hurting, I'm stuck in my bed
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
They all said it would fade, but again and again
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
